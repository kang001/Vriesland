function clickFunction()
{
	$('#image2').toggle('swing'); //this is a sample of a function in the jquery library
}



//in the html you have all the "physical" objects which you can style using classes and write the style on the css fileCreatedDate

//then the button had an onclick event, which was set to call the function sampleFunction

//config.xml has data and info about the plugins you want and information about the icon name and version of your app...you should only worry about this when you are ready to build the app on phonegap
